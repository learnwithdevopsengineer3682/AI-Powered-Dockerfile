# AI-Powered-Dockerfile

AI-Powered Dockerfile Optimization with Mistral & Ollama
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to optimize Dockerfiles using AI powered by the Mistral model with the Ollama CLI. The goal is to reduce the Docker image size and improve the build time by utilizing AI-driven optimizations. The demo includes:

Two Dockerfiles: One unoptimized and one optimized using Mistral.

GitHub Actions Pipelines: Automates the process of building and measuring the build time and image size.

Ollama CLI with Mistral: Optimizes the Dockerfile by suggesting improvements to reduce size and build time.

Features
Automated Dockerfile Optimization: Using the Mistral model via Ollama CLI.

Build Time Comparison: Measure the impact of optimizations on Docker build times.

Image Size Comparison: Show the before and after Docker image sizes.

GitHub Actions Integration: Set up pipelines to automate the process.

Free AI DevOps Resources: Share valuable links for learning more about AI and DevOps.

Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine or CI environment.

Ollama CLI: This project uses the Ollama CLI to run the Mistral model for optimization.

GitHub Account: To access GitHub Actions pipelines for CI/CD automation.

How to Run the Project Locally
Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your local machine.

Install Docker: Follow the installation instructions from Docker’s official site.

Install Ollama CLI: You can install Ollama CLI from Ollama's official website.

Step 2: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dockerfile-optimization.git
cd dockerfile-optimization

Step 3: Optimize Dockerfile Using Ollama & Mistral

CI/CD with GitHub Actions
This project includes GitHub Actions workflows to automate the process of building the Docker images and comparing the results.

Workflow 1: build-big.yml
Builds the unoptimized Dockerfile.

Measures the build time and Docker image size.

Workflow 2: ai-optimized.yml
Builds the optimized Dockerfile.

Measures the build time and Docker image size.

These workflows will automatically run when you push changes to the repository. You can find the workflows under the .github/workflows/ directory.
